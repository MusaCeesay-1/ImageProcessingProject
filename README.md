# Caesar Cipher and Image Processing Project

## Task 1: Caesar Cipher

### Description

This project implements a simple Caesar Cipher for encrypting and decrypting text. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.

### Features

- Encrypts plaintext using a specified shift value.
- Decrypts ciphertext using the same shift value.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Preserves non-alphabetic characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation).

### Usage

To use the Caesar Cipher script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/YourProject.git
    cd YourProject
    ```

2. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. The script is compatible with Python 3.

3. Run the script using the following command:
    ```sh
    python caesar_cipher.py
    ```

4. Follow the prompts to enter the text you wish to encrypt and the shift value.

### Example

Here is an example interaction with the script:


## Task 2: Image Processing

### Description

This task involves writing a Python script that swaps the left and right halves of an image horizontally. The script reads an input image, processes it to swap the left and right halves, and saves the resulting image.

### Usage

To use the image swapping script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the Pillow library installed:
    ```sh
    pip install pillow
    ```

2. Run the script using the following command:
    ```sh
    python swap_image.py
    ```

3. Follow the prompt to enter the path to the image you wish to process.

### Example

Here is an example interaction with the script:

Enter the path to the image: example.jpg

The script will process the image and save the swapped image as `swapped_image.png`.
